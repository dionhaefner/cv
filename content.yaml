    long-description: >
      At DHI GRAS, I built robust data pipelines and powerful machine
      learning tools on satellite images. Through low-level optimizations
      on one particularly expensive algorithm, I was able to cut processing
      times by over 3 orders of magnitude (from weeks to hours), while
      minimizing human supervision.

      I am the main developer of a full-blown, distributed ocean model
      written in pure Python with full GPU support (\emph{Veros},
      available on GitHub).
      Large simulations are only about 2 times slower than a Fortran
      reference implementation, while being orders of magnitude more
      approachable for students and scientists.

    title: PhD in Physical Oceanography
    institution: University of Copenhagen
    long-description: >
      In my PhD project at Niels Bohr Institute (Prof. Markus Jochum),
      I inferred the relative importance of different hypothesized causes
      of extreme ocean waves (``rogue waves'') in the real world.
      To this end, I analyzed over 1 Terabyte of observational data
      with data mining and probabilistic machine learning to extract
      robust, causal insights.

      During my PhD, I conducted a 3-month research visit to the Image Processing Lab at the
      \highlight{University of Valencia} (Prof. Gustau Camps-Valls), where I worked on how machine learning can help humans to understand
      climate models.
    description: >
      In my project, I use statistics / machine learning on large amounts of
      real-world data to quantify how and under which conditions extreme ocean
      waves (rogue waves) are generated.
