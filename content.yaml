tagline: >
  I am a Physics graduate specialized on all things scientific computing,
  with industry experience in data processing and machine learning.

  My main research interest is ``human learning'': How can we build machines
  that teach us something about our physical world?

    title: Software development specialist
    location: Hørsholm, Denmark
    start: 01-09-2017
    end: 01-12-2018
    long-description: >
      At DHI GRAS, I built robust data pipelines and powerful machine
      learning tools on satellite images. Through low-level optimizations
      on one particularly expensive algorithm, I was able to cut processing
      times by over 3 orders of magnitude (from weeks to hours), while
      minimizing human supervision.

    location: Copenhagen, Denmark
    start: 01-01-2017
    end: 01-08-2017
    long-description: >
      I am the main developer of a full-blown, distributed ocean model
      written in pure Python with full GPU support (\emph{Veros},
      available on GitHub).
      Large simulations are only about 2 times slower than a Fortran
      reference implementation, while being orders of magnitude more
      approachable for students and scientists.
    description: >
      I developed a full-blown, high-performance ocean model in pure Python.
      I was responsible for everything from the implementation of the
      numerics and the simulation framework, to quality assurance and
      documentation.

    location: Heidelberg, Germany
    start: 01-06-2014
    end: 01-12-2016
    long-description: >
      I enhanced a numerical simulation package based on the DUNE framework
      (\textit{DORiE}), written in C++ and Python.
      By implementing adaptive grid refinement, I was able to speed up
      simulations by a factor of up to 100.
    description: >
      Working in a small team of developers on a numerical software suite.
      Using C++, Python, Git; responsibilities include specification,
      implementation, testing, and deployment.

    title: PhD in Physical Oceanography
    institution: University of Copenhagen
    long-description: >
      In my PhD project, I infer the relative importance of different hypothesized causes
      of extreme ocean waves (``rogue waves'') in the real world.
      To this end, I analyze over 1 Terabyte of observational data
      with data mining and probabilistic machine learning to extract
      robust, interpretable insights.
    description: >
      In my project, I use statistics / machine learning on large amounts of
      real-world data to quantify how and under which conditions extreme ocean
      waves (rogue waves) are generated.
